					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I'm an electrical engineer that loves to program. When my day job started moving away from coding, I missed the challenge of constant problem solving that coding provides. I also started to see a lot of really cool websites around that were really beautiful and had cool animations and visual effects. I thought "I would love to create something like that, how do I do it?". And so this site details my journey from newbie to where I am today.</p>
					<h2>Current Status</h2>
					<p>I'm in the process of finalising this page at the end of the Thinkful Front End Developer Course. Next step is the Thinkful Angular.js course and then Ruby on Rails!</p>

					<a href="http://glenr4.github.io/weatherAPI" target="_blank"><h2>Worldwide Weather</h2></a>
					<p>This is the last assignment in the Thinkful Front End Developer course. I really enjoyed this one as it was actually quite easy to put together with some features that I thought were pretty cool.

					I used three APIs to make this app work:
						<ul>
							<li>A plugin for Google places with auto-complete place search</li>
							<li>The API from weather underground to get current and forecast weather from around the world</li>
							<li>And the Flickr API to get a background image of the place that the user searched for</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Some improvements that I could make with this are:
						<ul>
							<li>Lookup the users current location and display weather for where they are so that the page doesn't start blank</li>
							<li>Make the user experience for mobile better</li>
						</ul>

					<p>In this Thinkful project, I learned about how to implement Javascript objects in a practical example. In this quiz there are five static questions and each question is implemented as a Javascript object that is used to load the next question. Because of this structure, the quiz could be extended with many more questions and then have the five questions picked at random.</p>

					<p>This is the first project where we were basically told what needed to be done and there was no step through of code and very little guidance (the other projects we were to attempt ourselves with guidance and then a solution was given). I really liked this project as it was mainly functional rather than just layout. I chose a clean layout and I wanted to make cool animations for each transition. I am pretty happy with the result of this one. An obvious extension to this is to save the items to a list and be able to recall it. </p>

					<p>The object with this project in the Thinkful Front End Developer course was to get the look, layout and fonts virtually the same as the example website from Karma Mobility.</p>
					<p>See if you can pick the original.</p>
					<p>We had to run this on a webserver to get the font to load, so I fired up my WAMP server on my computer. And of course it didn't work! After a google search for the error that came up, there was a conflict on port 80. So then I had to track down the culprit with netstat. I found the process ID that was listening on port 80 and found out it was Skype! So I shutdown Skype and restarted the services on WAMP and it went green - good to go.</p>

			<h2>Getting Sublime Text Installed and Configured</h2>
			<p>First up you need a decent text editor with useful features to make your development more efficient. So we used Sublime text and installed Emmett which adds a lot of useful common coding shortcuts so that you don't spend all of your time typing angled brackets!</p>

		<h2>Thinkful Front End Web Development Course</h2>
		<p>I realised a few things about my web development experiences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I had rekindled my love of programming with something that was visually and functionally rewarding</li>
			<li>I was frustrated with my level of knowledge not being at the point where I could create what I wanted to create</li>
			<li>My learning path was unplanned and I had no idea what the industry norms were for doing common tasks</li>
		</ol>
		<p>So I started looking around for more online courses. I really wanted to do a bootcamp but at 12+ weeks fulltime, while looking after my family, it just wasn't an option.</p>
		<p>After looking through seek.com to see what skills companies are looking for in web development, it really comes down to three core skills:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>html</li>
			<li>css</li>
			<li>javascript</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Pretty much everything else builds on top of this. Then there is the server side stuff like php, ruby etc. but I thought, well I have to get the fundamentals down first, then I can branch out further.</p>
		<p>When I found the Thinkful Front End Developer course it ticked all of the boxes of what employers look for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>html, css, javascript</li>
			<li>Using github to backup and handle version control</li>
			<li>Create a portfolio of projects to demonstrate coding ability and making stuff work</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The price wasn't excessive and it also came with a mentor who I can talk to one on one once a week. So I thought I haven't found anything better than that, sign me up!</p>

			<h2>The early days</h2>
			<p>Well after some creating some websites firstly with Joomla, then Wordpress I got fed up with the restrictions that they or the theme that was installed posed. There was always something that I wanted different to what they allowed me to do. As someone who solves technical problems for a living, I got annoyed with this and thought there has to be a better way.</p>
			<p>I eventually came across bootstrap what a revelation! How easy was it to use, responsive and had lots of animated effects built in!</p>
			<p>After creating a few pages I wanted to change something in the navigation bar. Then I realised what a pain it is having to maintain the same pieces of code on each page. I did some googling but didn't find anything on how other people had solved this problem. So I thought, well the only actual related language that I know that could help here is php. So I created a navigation file in php and used the include function in my html, then I only had to maintain it in one place.</p>
			<p>When I was experimenting with Joomla and Wordpress, I initially set them up at home on a WAMP server. This was a relatively easy process but there are a few things that needed to be done to make it work:
				<ul>
					<li>Setup virtual servers so that the links have the correct path when deployed to the web</li>
					<li>Editing hosts file to map my websites to localhost</li>
					<li>Security to limit connections from my LAN only</li>
				</ul>
