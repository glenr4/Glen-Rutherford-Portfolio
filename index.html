		<h2>Karma Replica</h2>
		<p>The object with this project in the Thinkful Front End Developer course was to get the look, layout and fonts virtually the same as the example website from Karma Mobility</p>
		<p>See if you can click on the original</p>
		<!-- split the picture into two parts and cut off the URLs. THen adjust what is displayed on the next page based on what the user clicked -->

		<p>We had to run this on a webserver to get the font to load, so I fired up my WAMP server on my computer. And of course it didn't work! After a google search for the error that came up, there was a conflict on port 80. So then I had to track down the culprit with netstat. I found the process ID that was listening on port 80 and found out it was Skype! So I shutdown Skype and restarted the services on WAMP and it went green - good to go.</p>

		<h2>Hack the times</h2>
		<p>I had already used Firebug in Firefox and the Inspector in Chrome to see what was going in the browser before. This exercise just got us to turn styles on and off and then drag divs around the html file to mess up the New York Times website.</p>

		<h2>About me page</h2>
		<p>This one we just had to put together a few things about ourselves with a nice picture at the top. We created this on codepen which has a pretty good interface and also has the server already setup for you.</p>

		<h2>The first project</h2>
		<p>This one was super simple and made for people who had never touched html before. So here it is, nothing fancy.</p>

		<h2>Getting Sublime Text Installed and Configured</h2>
		<p>First up you need a decent text editor with useful features to make your development more efficient. So we used Sublime text and installed the addin called Emmett which adds a lot of useful common coding shortcuts so that you don't spend all of your time typing angled brackets!</p>

	<h2>Thinkful Front End Web Development Course</h2>
	<p>I realised a few things about my web development experiences:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>I had rekindled my love of programming with something that was visually and functionally rewarding</li>
		<li>I was frustrated with my level of knowledge not being at the point where I could create what I wanted to create</li>
		<li>My learning path was unplanned and I had no idea what the industry norms were for doing common tasks</li>
	</ol>
	<p>So I started looking around for more online courses. I really wanted to do a bootcamp but at 12+ weeks fulltime, while looking after my family, it just wasn't and option.</p>
	<p>After looking through seek.com a lot to see what skills companies are looking for in web development, it really comes down to three core skills:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>html</li>
		<li>css</li>
		<li>javascript</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Pretty much everything else builds on top of this. Then there is the server side stuff like php, ruby etc. but I thought, well I have to get the fundamentals down first, then I can branch out into more fancy stuff.</p>
	<p>When I found the Thinkful Front End Developer course it ticked all of the boxes of what employers look for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>html, css, javascript</li>
		<li>Using github to backup and handle version control</li>
		<li>Create a portfolio of projects to demonstrate coding ability and making stuff work</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The price wasn't excessive and it also came with a mentor who I can talk to one on one once a week. So I thought it doesn't get any better than that, sign me up!</p>

		<h2>The early days</h2>
		<p>Well after some creating some websites firstly with Joomla, then Wordpress I got fed up with the restrictions that they or the theme that was installed posed. There was always something that I wanted different to what they allowed me to do. As someone who solves technical problems for a living, I got annoyed with this and thought there has to be a better way. </p>
		<p>I eventually came across bootstrap what a revelation! How easy was it to use, responsive and had lots of animated effects built in!</p>
		<p>After creating a few pages and I wanted to change something in the navigation bar. Then I realised what a pain it is having to maintain the same pieces of code on each page. I did some googling but didn't find anything on how other people had solved this problem. So I thought, well the only actual related language that I know that could help here is php. So I created a navigation file in php and used the include function in my html, then I only had to maintain it in one place.</p>
