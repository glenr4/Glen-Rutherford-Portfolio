					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I'm an electrical engineer that loves to program. When my day job started moving away from coding, I missed the challenge of constant problem solving that coding provides. I also started to see a lot of really cool websites around that were really beautiful and had cool animations and visual effects. I thought "I would love to create something like that, how do I do it?". And so this site details my journey from newbie to where I am today.</p>
					<h2>About This Page</h2>
					<p>This is my current portfolio that I will keep adding to as I create new and hopefully interesting things. I used Bootstrap to make this page as it makes the layout super easy and works on mobile devices too. No point in reinventing the wheel I reckon.</p>
					<h2>Current Status</h2>
					<p>I'm in the process of finalising this page at the end of the Thinkful Front End Developer Course. Next step is the Thinkful Angular.js course and then Ruby on Rails!</p>
					<p>I am looking to further my skills and keen to work on any sort of project involving jQuery/Angular/front end development, so if you need a hand, then drop me a line at: <a href="mailto:glenrutherford4@gmail.com">glenrutherford4@gmail.com</a>.</p>

					<a href="http://glenr4.github.io/weatherAPI" target="_blank"><h2>Worldwide Weather</h2></a>
					<p>This is the last assignment in the Thinkful Front End Developer course. I really enjoyed this one. It was actually quite easy to put together with some features that I thought were pretty cool.

					I used three APIs to make this app work:
						<ul>
							<li>A <a href="https://ubilabs.github.io/geocomplete/" target="_blank">plugin</a> for Google Places with auto-complete search</li>
							<li>The API from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/" target="_blank">Weather Underground</a> to get current and forecast weather from around the world</li>
							<li>And the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/" target="_blank">Flickr API</a> to get a background image of the place that the user searched for</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Some improvements that I could make with this are:
						<ul>
							<li>Lookup the user's current location and display weather for where they are, so that the page doesn't start blank</li>
							<li>Make the user experience for mobile better - perhaps using Bootstrap</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p>This Thinkful project started from an existing GitHub repository. The focus was purely on the API. This app uses the <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Stack Exchange API</a> to get data from the Stack Overflow site. </p>
					<p>Two different end points were used, one to get unanswered questions regarding a particular keyword. The other to get the top answerers (is that even a real word?) for a particular keyword.</p>

					<p>Some improvements that I could make with this are:
						<ul>
							<li>The styling wasn't part of the assignment but can definitely be improved upon

					<p>In this Thinkful project, I learned about how to implement Javascript objects in a practical example.</p> 
					<p>This quiz has five static questions. Each question is implemented as a Javascript object. When the user clicks the Next Question button, the next question object is used to update the same page. Through the use of Javascript objects, the quiz could be scaled with many more questions and then have the five questions picked at random.</p>

					<p>This project started with the front end already done and we were to implement the Javascript.</p>
					<p>This app generates a random number between 1 and 100, then takes the user's guess and gives feedback on how close the guess was. The guesses are listed at the bottom and the number of guesses are counted. The app also checks if the guess is actually a number and if it is within the correct range.</p>

					<p>This is the first project where we were basically told what needed to be done and there was no step through of code and very little guidance (in the other projects we were to attempt the code ourselves with guidance and then a solution was given).</p> 
					<p>I really liked this project as it was mainly functional rather than just layout. I chose a clean layout and I wanted to make cool animations for each transition. I am pretty happy with the result of this one.</p> 
					<p>An obvious extension to this is to save the items to a list and be able to recall it. </p>

					<p>This project introduced some basic animations in jQuery. The main animation was actually done in the gif files provided by Thinkful. So this was just really dipping my toes in the water and seeing what jQuery can do. But it brought back memories from my days as a kid in the arcades!</p>
